THIS DOC COVERS THE SETUP PROCESS OF  "surveydesign" APPLICATION IN ANY NEW BLACKWIDOW PROJECT.

This app is mainly built with django, nodejs and angularjs. The app is compatible with python 3.5.2 and django 1.11.3.
Though not tested yet but the app should work fine with higher versions of python and django. Angularjs version is 1.2.5.
And the app is tested with node version 4.2.6.

Step 1: Install the Survey Module with `pip install surveydesign` as like `blackwidow.core` library.

Step 2: You need to install nodejs, nodejs-legacy and npm. Try the following commands:
        sudo apt-get install nodejs
        sudo apt-get install npm
        sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy


Step 3: In the project's settings.py file include 'surveydesign', 'taggit' and 'reversion' inside the INSTALLED_APPS tuple.
        For reference I have added 'surveydesign' in BW_APPS tuple inside:
        'project_root'/config/apps.py file.

        But 'taggit' and 'reversion' were added inside the INSTALLED_APPS tuple in the projects's settings.py file.

Step 4: Now run the routine initialization commands as always in your project.
        a. python manage.py bw_make_init
        b. python manage.py bw_init_migrations
        c. python manage.py makemigrations
        d. python manage.py migrate
        e. python manage.py bw_init_data




Step 5: You are ready to go now. Run the server and you will find the survey design app in root_url/survey-design url.
        For example if you run the project on 127.0.0.1:8000 go to the following link:
        http://127.0.0.1:8000/survey-design

        You are also supposed to get a link to the app named 'Survey Design' in the Survey sidebar of Admin module.
        If you don't get this link in the sidebar or you want to show the sidebar link in some other module then
        use the following method:
        from surveydesign.utils.decorators import update_model_decorator
        And use the function in following way:


        ######       python Example Code Starts Here    ######

        from blackwidow.engine.decorators.expose_model import expose_api
        from blackwidow.engine.decorators.route_partial_routes import route
        from blackwidow.engine.decorators.utility import is_object_context, has_status_data
        from blackwidow.core.enums.modules_enum import ModuleEnum

        from surveydesign.models import SurveyResponse
        from surveydesign.utils.decrators import update_model_decorator

        update_model_decorator(SurveyResponse, expose_api('survey-response'), is_object_context, has_status_data,
                               route(route='survey-response', group='Logs', module=ModuleEnum.Settings,
                                     display_name='Survey Response')
                               )
