THIS DOC COVERS THE SETUP PROCESS OF  "dbmediabackup" APPLICATION IN ANY NEW PROJECT.

DBMediaBackup Manager:
This Django App provides methods to help backup and restore database and media files with Dropbox client storage.


##Dropbox Account Setup##
In order to backup/restore to Dropbox, first we need to create a Dropbox account and set it up to communicate
with the "dbmediabackup" application. Nothing to worry, all instructions are given below:
1. Login to Dropbox and navigate to Developers->MyApps
	https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
2. Click the button named "Create app" to create a new app on the Dropbox Platform.
3. Choose an API from given options("Dropbox API" or "Dropbox Business API"). For reference I selected "Dropbox API".
4. Choose the type of access you need from given options("App folder" or "Full Dropbox"). For reference I selected "App folder".
5. Give an appropriate name of the app. For reference I named mine "BackupManager".
6. After app is created, click on your created app. Note the button named "Generate".
7. Click the button named "Generate" to generate oauth2_access_token, this value will need later.
(By generating an access token, you will be able to make API calls for your own account without going through the authorization flow).

##Postgresql Client Installation on Linux Host Server##

but install the PostgreSQL client package instead. To do this, use the following command:
	sudo apt-get install postgresql-client
